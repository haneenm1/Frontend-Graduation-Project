            <h2>1. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social interaction, communication, and behavior.
                It typically appears in early childhood and varies widely in severity. The disorder is part of a spectrum,
                meaning that individuals with ASD may experience different levels of impairment and strengths.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong><br>
                Difficulty with social interactions, limited verbal communication, repetitive behaviors, and intense interest in specific topics.
                Sensory sensitivities may also occur, including over-sensitivity to lights, sounds, or touch.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>How to Deal with the Condition:</strong><br>
                Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial. Behavioral therapy (e.g., ABA),
                 special education services, and support from caregivers help children with ASD develop social and communication skills.
                  Medications may be prescribed to address co-occurring conditions like anxiety or hyperactivity.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Tips:</strong><br>
                Create a structured routine, use visual supports like schedules and pictures,
                and practice social skills through role-playing. Consistency and patience are key in supporting children with ASD.
